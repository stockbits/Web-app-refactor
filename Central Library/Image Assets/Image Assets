Image Assets History:
- Established: January 2026
- Purpose: Store reusable illustrations, icons, and photography guidelines for the shared library.
- Notes: Keep assets optimized (SVG/WEBP first) and document licensing per file.

Supporting Logos (Jan 2026):
- Openreach Primary Logo (color) — Logos/Openreach-Logo.jpeg
	- Source: https://www.openreach.com header fragment (retrieved 2026-01-02).
	- Usage: Standard light backgrounds or photographic overlays with ≥ 70% brightness.
- Openreach Knockout Logo (white) — Logos/Openreach-Logo-White.png
	- Source: https://www.openreach.com footer fragment (retrieved 2026-01-02).
	- Usage: Dark green/blue hero blocks per new brand; maintain 24px min padding around the mark.
	- Consumption: Imported directly by central-app via the `@central-logos` alias; keep filename stable.

Note: The Vite app references these logo files via an alias, so renaming or moving them requires updating `central-app/app/vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`.

Future work: replace with official SVG set once the refreshed asset kit is published; track licensing in this file when updating.
