React Framework History:
- Established: January 2026
- Purpose: Host common React utilities, hooks, and shared component scaffolding.
- Notes: Document component contracts, keep stories/tests adjacent, prefer TypeScript strict mode.

General React Libraries:
- Material UI DataGrid — primary table component for most screens: https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/
- Material UI Components — text fields, dropdowns, cards, chips, drawers, and more: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/
- Bryntum Scheduler — renders the scheduling chart experience: https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/
- Highcharts React — dashboards and analytical charts: https://www.highcharts.com/integrations/react/
- Material Design 3 — baseline for typography, icons, color, spacing: https://m3.material.io/
- MUI X DataGrid density control demo — reference for accessibility-friendly density switching: https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/accessibility/#set-the-density-programmatically

Installed Stack Snapshot (central-app, Jan 2026):
- Runtime deps: React 19.2, React DOM 19.2, @mui/material 7.3, @mui/icons-material 7.3, @mui/x-data-grid 8.23, @emotion/react 11.14, @emotion/styled 11.14.
- Tooling deps: Vite 7.2, TypeScript 5.9, @vitejs/plugin-react 5.1, eslint 9.39 with React Hooks/Refresh plugins, types for React/Node, globals, typescript-eslint.
- Project scaffold: Runtime code lives in /central-app/src, while the tooling stack (package.json, Vite, tsconfig, node_modules) stays isolated in /central-app/app. The app folder keeps a local src symlink back to the top-level directory, and the repo root exposes node_modules as a symlink to /central-app/app/node_modules so npm scripts (run from /central-app/app) operate normally without cluttering the root.

UI Patterns:
- Docked Dialog (Task): Minimal MUI implementation using chips. See src/Openreach - App/App - Shared Components/MUI - More Info Component/TaskDockBar.tsx and its integration in Operations Management/Task Management page. Limit dock to five items; clicking chip restores dialog; delete removes.
